# An apparently self-indulgent yc-application - laughing my way through a Paradox
What happens when you "input" Recursion (https://recursion.is) into a function that encodes Recursion (https://apply.ycombinator.com/)? Well, [Stack Overflow!](https://youtu.be/3VQ382QG-y4?t=806) I represent Recursion. I have spent my entire life working towards this one Idea. So, when you take me, the very embodiment of Recursion (from my perspective), and you "input" me into the equation "the Y Combinator", a function that encodes Recursion, you get a very interesting paradox. I internally dealt with this paradox by literally laughing my way through every single prompt in this application. [Laughing](https://discord.com/channels/666027393214840843/962997168061435904) > [Stack Overflowing](https://youtu.be/0btACKCzz6I). The extremely difficult part is convincing you all that I am seriously attacking a paradox here and not joking. So, I did my very best to show you how serious my work is. Even through [shear quantity](https://notes.recursion.is). Sorry to the YC team, our original application was a stream of Jokes that only Nick understood. Hopefully, by explaining these jokes in this open-source application we can attempt to show you how impactful this all is and will be. I sincerely hope the YC Team will understand me during this batch, however they may never understand until they speak to us at length.
